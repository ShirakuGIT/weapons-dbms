# Securus

Securus is a comprehensive weapon management system designed to ensure the highest levels of security and accountability. Leveraging the robustness of blockchain technology, Securus provides a decentralized approach to the tracking and management of weapon transactions. At its core, it integrates modern web technologies with Ethereum blockchain to create a reliable and transparent record-keeping system.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Weapon registration, update, and tracking via Ethereum blockchain using Truffle and Ganache.
- CRUD operations for weapon and transaction records in a PostgreSQL database.
- API endpoints for managing weapons, transactions, and user roles.
